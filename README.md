### Important Note for Users in India Using Jio as their Internet Service Provider
If you are accessing this repository from India and your Internet Service Provider is JIO, you may encounter issues viewing images within markdown files due to the ISP's internal policies.
**Workaround:**
To resolve this issue, you can configure your DNS settings to access the images. We recommend using Google's DNS. Follow the steps below:
- Open your network settings.
- Configure your DNS settings to use Google's DNS servers:
  - Primary DNS: 8.8.8.8
  - Secondary DNS: 8.8.4.4
By updating your DNS settings, you should be able to view images within the markdown files without any interruptions.
If you need assistance with updating your DNS settings, you can refer to [whatismyip.com/google-dns](https://www.whatismyip.com/google-dns/) for detailed instructions.
